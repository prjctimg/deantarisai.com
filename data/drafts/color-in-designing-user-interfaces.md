## Color in designing user interfaces:

One of the most important aspects of UI design, color plays an important role in defining the visual hierarchy of the elements on the screen. Without it, our design would be flat and convey information less accurately. 

### How color influences the presentation of information

Color is used all around us to convey information; traffic lights for example use red, amber and green to indicate vehicles to stop, get ready to move and to move respectively. 

Therefore it makes sense that color works in a similar fashion in our designs. By following a design guide we can allocate different roles to colors helping our users understand what's going on before they even bring their full focus to the event taking place on their screens. 

In short this means that we can associate certain types of information with specific colors allowing users to be aware of the scope of information/action that they are taking. 

### Applying color to our design elements sensibly.

The use of color extends beyond aesthetic reasons,it can be used to distinguish which elements are interactive (i.e clickable) or surfaces.

A good example is that of buttons (i.e Calls to Action or CTA). The primary CTA is assigned the primary colour in the palette in our design guide. This denotes that this CTA has priority in the user interface therefore its sole purpose is to attract users attention as soon as possible. In cases such as this it is wiser to use the primary colour sparingly otherwise it will lose its importance by becoming common in the UI.

### Using colors to achieve contrast: Background and foreground 

Material Design Guidelines specify that the background color should be subdued so that it doesn't draw attention to itself. This can be shown by placing a dull coloured element on top of a highly saturated background. This causes a reversal of hierarchy because saturated colors draw more attention than dull or muted ones.

Tints can be applied to surfaces to help highlight the current scope of user actions and/or information.

For example when a transaction has been successful on banking website you might expect to see the confirmation message written on a slight green/blue surface which will give you feedback that the transaction was successful even before you read the confirmation text. However,if the user sees a dialogue or prompt being displayed on a red tinted surface they'll already know that something went wrong even before they read the specifics of the error encontered.

In short,colors help users understand the current state of the system at a glance because no one likes to read when they're browsing on your website and trying to get a goal achieved. This will ultimately lead to a better user experience because they're getting instant response.
