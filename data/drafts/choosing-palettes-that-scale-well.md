## Choosing the right palette and/or theme for your project

Picking the right colors for a project is beyond choosing which color "looks good" because in most cases functionality comes first and then aesthetic value can be considered later. This is because clients what they're requirements met and this means that we need to have a systematic way of choosing our palette. This not only helps push the brand message forward it can allow us to be creative with the palette if ever we consider extending the design. Inevitably, it means that our palette has to scale gracefully as the project grows as well allowing designers to remain flexible whilst working with the palette.

Since too much colour is never a good thing when designing user interfaces,it helps to have a limited palette with a few color options that we can split into tonal palettes giving us flexibility in our design whilst keeping the hues used in the project to a minimum.
